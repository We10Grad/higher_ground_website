          <h2>A Neighbor You Can Trust With Your Yard</h2>
          <p>
            Kyle started Higher Ground Stump Grinding after seeing how many homeowners were left with old, unsafe stumps
            and no clear, straightforward option to remove them. With a background in hands-on work and a passion for
            clean, well-kept outdoor spaces, he set out to build a stump grinding service focused on quality, safety, and integrity.
