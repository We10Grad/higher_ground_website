          <h2>How do you decide pricing for stump grinding?</h2>
          <p>
            Pricing is based on a combination of <strong>stump size</strong>, <strong>tree type</strong>, and how easy
            it is to access the stump with our equipment. On top of that, we offer three service levels so you can choose
            how much cleanup and restoration you’d like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Full Restoration</strong> – We grind the stump and roots to the appropriate depth, remove the grindings,
              and bring in fresh soil and leveling so the area is ready for new grass or landscaping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standard Plus</strong> – We grind the stump and roots, rake the area smooth, and do a moderate cleanup
              of excess grindings so the area is neat and ready for your next step.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standard</strong> – We grind the stump and roots to standard depth and leave the grindings neatly
              piled or spread for you to handle as you prefer. This is the most budget-friendly option.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once we know the size, tree type, and service level you want, we can provide a clear, itemized quote.

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h2>How long does it take to get my stump ground?</h2>
          <p>
            For a typical residential stump, the actual grinding usually takes <strong>less than an hour</strong>, and
            even multiple stumps can often be completed in a single visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scheduling depends slightly on the season and current workload, but in most cases we can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a bid within <strong>24–48 hours</strong> of getting your stump details</li>
            <li>Schedule most jobs within a few days of your approval</li>
            <li>Work efficiently on-site to minimize disruption to you and your neighbors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you have a specific deadline—for example, new sod or a landscaping project—we’ll do our best to work with your timeline.

          <h2>How do I get a bid for the cost of my stump?</h2>
          <p>
            The best way to get an accurate bid is to share the <strong>stump size</strong> (diameter across the widest point)
            and the <strong>tree type</strong> (for example, oak, pine, maple, etc.). Those factors, plus access to the stump,
            help us estimate how long the job will take and which service level fits best.
          </p>
          <p>You can request a bid in a few simple steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Measure the stump across the widest part in inches.</li>
            <li>Note the tree type if you know it (or send a quick photo).</li>
            <li>Let us know how many stumps you have and where they’re located on your property.</li>
            <li>Fill out the contact form on our <a href="index.html#contact">homepage</a> or send us your info by email/text with photos.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            With that information, we can send you a clear quote that shows the price for Full Restoration, Standard Plus,
            and Standard so you can pick what works best for you.
